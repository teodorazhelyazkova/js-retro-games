## JavaScript Games 
This is my first attempt at coding games by using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 
All games are based on a [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/ec8vSKJuZTk) from [Ania Kubow](https://github.com/kubowania). You can find her GitHub repositories for each game below:
- [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/kubowania/rock-paper-scissors-x3) 
- [Memory Game](https://github.com/kubowania/memory-game) 
- [Whac-a-mole](https://github.com/kubowania/whac-a-mole)
